# Technical Report - Vital Statistics of Professional Athletes

## Problem Statement
### What impact does a career in professional sports have on the life expectancy of an athlete?

More specifically:
- Do different sports have different levels of impact on athletes' life expectancies?
- Are life expectancies further affected by the length of the playing career, the number of games played, or the positions they played?
- Can I build a model that predicts how many players will die in a given year, as well as the distribution of their ages when they died? Would this model be better than one based on vital statistics of the general population?
