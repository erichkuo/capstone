    "### What impact does a career in professional sports have on the life expectancy of an athlete?\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically:\n",
    "- Do different sports have different levels of impact on athletes' life expectancies?\n",
    "- Are life expectancies further affected by the length of the playing career, the number of games played, or the positions they played?\n",
    "- Can I build a model that predicts how many players will die in a given year, as well as the distribution of their ages when they died? Would this model be better than one based on vital statistics of the general population?"

They also list the length of their careers, when they played, and the total number of games played. The football site lists the players' positions, while the baseball site merely separates batters from pitchers. The football site also lists coaches along with players.\n",
