I have been able to gather data of professional athletes from the NFL, NHL, and Major League Baseball who have died in the last 50 years. I also gathered data for all NBA players, both living and deceased. A Jupyter notebook has the code for scraping athlete databases, and the data is saved in several csv files. It is possible that I may need to gather additional data if I decide to answer questions a different way (such as studying all NFL players who were born in a certain year).

I have done a preliminary EDA on my data. There are some players for which exact birth or death dates are not fully known. Also, the NFL data include coaches along with players.

I haven't decided exactly how to answer my questions about how careers in pro sports affect life expectancy. Some approaches might be to compare the distribution of age of deaths in a particular year among athletes against the distribution for the general population, or that of males. Or I might want to compare athletes born in a certain year and see how their distribution of ages at death compare to the general population. Ultimately, I plan to create a model that predicts how many athletes will die next year, and what their ages will be.

I also need to decide which set of vital statistics of the general population I want to use. Some possibilities include actuarial life tables from the Social Security Administration; yearly birth rates in the U.S. (maybe Canada also, for hockey players); or yearly death rates in the U.S.

Within the next two weeks, I hope to settle on a method of modeling death rates (or maybe try several approaches). I will gather any additional player data as necessary. Since I know where to look and have already gathered data from each sports league, I do not see a problem in acquiring data.
