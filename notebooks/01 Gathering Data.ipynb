    "- Do different sports have different levels of impact on athletes' life expectancies?\n",
    "- Are life expectancies further affected by the length of the playing career, the number of games played, or the positions they played?\n",
    "- Can I build a model that predicts how many players will die in a given year, as well as the distribution of their ages when they died? Would this model be better than one based on vital statistics of the general population?"

While they list the legnth of careers and number of games played, they do not list their birthdates or ages.
