# Vital Statistics of Professional Athletes

What impact does a career in professional sports have on the life expectancy of an athlete? Does the impact increase with the length of a career?

## Goals

The goals of this project are to:

1) Model the number of players that will die in a given year
2) Determine how the distribution of ages at death of athletes compare to the general population
3) Determine whether an athlete's age of death is affected by features such as the length of his career, number of games played, height, and weight.
4) See if a useful model can be built to predict whether a particular player is alive or deceased, or how long he will live
